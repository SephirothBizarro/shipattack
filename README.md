Ship Attack! Sample Game
=====================
Game Progamming Algorithms and Techniques  
By: Sanjay Madhav

Information
-----------
This code is a sample side-scrolling game from my book. While the code
contained herein does have some commenting, for a more comprehensive
analysis of the code, you should read the corresponding chapter from
the book (13).

For any updates to this code, more detailed build instructions,
as well as download links to binaries, visit the page for this project
on the book's website at:
http://gamealgorithms.net/source-code/shipattack/.

Building
--------
The project can only be opened on a Mac with Xcode. I used 4.6.3, but it
probably will also work on newer versions.

Open up shipattack.xcodeproj and it will build for iOS without any further
steps. If you do not have a Mac, you can still browse the source files
that are in the shipattack sub-directory. Note that all of the files
under the libs directory are default cocos2d files, and they aren't
modified for this project.

License
-------
The code specific to shipattack is released under the BSD License, which
more or less means you can use it for whatever you want to, commerical or
not.

Though not required, it would be nice if you gave attribution if you end
up using this code in a game of yours. At the very least, I'd love to
hear about any games that end up doing so.

I'm not a lawyer, though, so you'll want to read the full LICENSE.md file.
